            <p>DESCRIPTION: Lamborghini is an Italian brand and manufacturer of luxury sports cars and is owned by the Volkswagen group. The logo is attributed to the brand founder Ferruccio Lamborghini whose penchant for Spanish bullfighting sport has taken its shape in the logo. Even though Lamborghini was not meant to be a racing car brand, these cars have won many races. Compared to other supercar brands, Lamborghini is almost new in the car industry but has left others behind. The high-end performance, design and comfort of these supercars make them extremely special.
