    <h3>HTML Formatting</h3>
    <!-- bold b, italic i, emphasize em, mark, superscript sup, subsctipt sub, del, underline u, etc -->
    <!-- bold text b -->
    <p>This is a <b>BOLD</b> text</p>
    <p>This is a <i>Italized</i> text</p>
    <p>This is a <em>Emphasized</em> text</p>
    <p>This is a <mark>Marked</mark> text</p>
    <p>2<sup>10</sup> = 1024</p>
    <p>H<sub>2</sub>0</p>
    <p>This is a <del>Deleted</del> text</p>
    <p>This is an <u>Underlined </u> text</p>

    <h2>Formatting Exercise</h2>

    <p>I have been creating <i>challenges</i> since <b>November 22, 2019.</b> Since then I have created four challenges such as <i>30 Days Of HTML, 30 Days Of JavaScript, 30 Days Of Python</i> and <i>30 Days Of react.</i> The <mark>30 Days Of JavaScript</mark> is the most popular among the four challenges. While I was preparing these challenges, I was taking lots of caffeine (C <sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O) but I didn't take any <del>beer</del> (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH) instead I was taking more <u>juice</u>. Do you think the comparison is correct, 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024? If your answer is yes, then you know <u>exponential.</u></p>
